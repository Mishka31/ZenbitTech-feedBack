### Front-End 
... was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The front-end was written in Rect.js with the use of auxiliary libraries:
"axios", "react-dom", "react-router-dom"
The use of "useState" made the task easier, for styling I used a modular connection with a style file.

### Back-End
... was bootstrapped with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and files in this Repo. folder '[server](https://github.com/Mishka31/zenbit-feedback/tree/main/server)'.
The Back-End use of auxiliary libraries:
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "cross-env": "7.0.3",
    "dotenv": "^15.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.2",
    "joi": "^17.6.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15",
    "pg": "^8.7.1"

In my opinion, separating the backend and frontend into different repositories makes it easier and faster to work. At the same time, I refreshed my understanding of deploying and connecting to the Monoi DB database. No additional steps are required to launch the backend repository. The backend was written with Node/js and Express.js
CRUD technology was used to write the database
